React Practical Day 07: Parent-Child Communication

This React practical demonstrates parent-to-child and child-to-parent communication using props and state in a functional component setup.

### **Files**
1. **App.js**: Contains the parent component that manages state and passes a callback function to the child component.
2. **Childcom.js**: Represents the child component, which uses the parent's callback to send data back.
